# Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze student performance data and develop metrics to evaluate their efforts and progress. The project involves preprocessing heterogeneous student data, conducting statistical analyses, and building machine learning models to derive insights.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting various statistical analyses to understand student performance.
- **Course Influence Analysis**: Using the Random Forest algorithm to identify courses that have the most significant impact on student performance.
- **Difficulty Metric**: Creating a metric to evaluate the difficulty of each course.
- **Outcome Prediction**: Building linear regression models to predict student outcomes based on their efforts and progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques and libraries for handling and preparing data.
- **Statistics**: Methods and tools for conducting statistical analyses.
- **RandomForest**: An ensemble learning method used for identifying influential courses.
- **LinearRegression**: A regression analysis technique used for predicting student outcomes.
